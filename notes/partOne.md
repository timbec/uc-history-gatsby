### Using Gatsby.js with Context API: 

https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/6258
https://hackernoon.com/how-to-get-started-with-the-react-context-api-ccc41728fa59

- it seems Gatsby works fine with Context API. Much rather use Context if possible to avoid the dreaded props drilling. 

question here is whether to use componentDidMount() with graphQL or not, and how to incorporate gatsby.js with what I learned in 'r0ad to react'.

A guide to gatsby lifecycle: 

https://medium.com/narative/understanding-gatsbys-lifecycle-31c473ba2f2d

have to figure out how to use graphQL with 
local Component State
HAVE TO GO BACK THROUGH BOOK FROM 'Basics In React'

Also, go back and watch Mead's video(s) on 'gatsby.node.js'. I don't really understand how data is collected and how the lifecycle works. 

This seems to provide a good guide:

WOULD I BE BETTER OFF JUST USING REGULAR AXIOS CALL FOR THE TIME BEING (JUST FOR THE SEARCH PAGE)?
